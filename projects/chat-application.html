Overview</h2><p class="project-description">The idea of this project intends to design an application using a fullstack workflow involving modern styles of coding which would be precompiled before sending anything to the client.
Jae and myself worked together to design a chat application which focused on the development of the app itself, rather than the application.
Every aspect of the project avoided the use of HTML, CSS, and native Javascript. Instead, we wrote our code using transpilers which allowed us to design the site in the most current coding standards,
but still provide accessible code to all browsers. The idea is the browsers are limited in their ability to read the newest code. Most modern websites are coding on newer code than what the client actually receives,
and we wanted to explore this concept and handle the precompiling ourselves.</p><div class="center"><img class="clickable-image scaled-image" src="../images/chat_application.png"></div></div><div class="bannerInfo"><div class="float-content"><h2 class="project-heading banner-header">Goals</h2><p>1. Design a chat application which could store users in a Firebase database, utilizing their authentication services</p><p>2. Code everything in the latests standards, using transpilers to precompile code so that all browsers could natively read code</p></div></div><div class="float-content padding"><h2 class="project-heading">Process</h2><div class="project-step"><div class="project-subheading"><span>01</span><h3>FIREBASE</h3></div><p>We utilized Firebase as our database as it is an easy to set up, free to use database service hosted by Google. We were able to store users and hashed passwords on a Google server,
which would then offhand the authentication to Firebase, leaving on the chat application services to be handled from our application. We then would request authentication with the
existing database before logging the user into the client. Note that Firebase includes chat application services; however, the purpose of our project required we implement our own application.
The setup for Firebase is extremely straight-forward. Create an account, setup a database, get an access key, and setup the Firebase framework on your frontend code.</p><div class="center"><a href="https://firebase.google.com/"><img class="clickable-image icon" src="../images/firebase.png"></a></div></div><div class="project-step"><div class="project-subheading"><span>02</span><h3>BABEL</h3></div><p>In order to allow our code to be written using ES6, we required a precompiler which would convert the more modern ES6 code into the browser safe ES5. We design our server,
which ran NodeJS, to use the NPM module called Babel. This module could transpile code from ES6 to ES5 and even bundle all of our dependencies into a single file which the client would receieve.
Utilizing ES6 allows for much greater coding advantages such as classes, string formating, and much more.</p><div class="center"><a href="https://babeljs.io/"><img class="clickable-image icon" src="../images/es6.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="project-step"><div class="project-subheading"><span>03</span><h3>SASS</h3></div><p>The project replaced CSS with a more fluid and dynamic language called SCSS, which would be handled by another node module called SASS. The SASS module allows us to transpile .scss formats into .css.
We gain a large amount of benefits from utilizing this, including: mixins, variables, importing, and encapsulating families of css classes together.</p><div class="center"><a href="https://sass-lang.com/"><img class="clickable-image icon" src="../images/sass.png"></a></div></div><div class="project-step"><div class="project-subheading"><span>04</span><h3>PUG</h3></div><p>One of the much needed improvements included the replacement of HTML. PUG, formerly known as Jade, is a templating format which replaces HTML.
The tag format creates too much clutter in the code, so PUG replaces these with indentations. We can also pass objects from the server into the PUG files before they are transpiled back into HTML for the client's browser.
This allows for interation over an array of elements that can be displayed in a list or dynamic information on the page.</p><div class="center"><a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html"><img class="clickable-image icon" src="../images/pug.png"></a></div></div></div><div class="bannerInfo"><div class="float-content"><h2 class="project-heading">OUTCOME</h2><p>All the coding in the project allowed us to design code faster and much more cleanly than if we were to have used native HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Adding an abstraction of the transpiler for our code allows for advancing Fullstack development without the restrictions of browsers affecting us.
Once the project's code was completed and everything worked as expected, we designed a presentation to illustrate our findings.
At Vancouver's Harbor Center we invited many developers from the area to take place in a discussion of frontend code. Our findings helped clarify a lot of the workings of how frameworks such as Webpack,
which is known for performing many of these tasks under the hood.</p></div></div></div><div class="mobile-menu"><ul class="navList"><li class="drop-down-container"><span>PROJECTS</span><i class="drop-down-caret material-icons">arrow_drop_down</i><ul class="drop-down"><li><a href="./projects/jpg-encoder.html">JPG ENCODER</a></li><li><a href="./projects/chat-application.html">CHAT APPLICATION </a></li></ul></li><li class="drop-down-container"><span>GAME DESIGN</span><i class="drop-down-caret material-icons">arrow_drop_down</i><ul class="drop-down"><li><a href="./game-design/project-sleep.html">PROJECT SLEEP</a></li><li><a href="./game-design/king-slayer.html">KING SLAYER</a></li><li><a href="./game-design/modding.html">MODDING</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="/3d-models.html">3D MODELS</a></li><li><a href="/contact.html">CONTACT</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
